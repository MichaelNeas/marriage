    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <p>
      If you have any additional questions that aren't listed below, please text Daley at 
      <a href="tel:+18025650030">802-565-0030</a>!
    </p>
  
    <h3>Is this a wedding? Aren't you already married? Will there be a ceremony?</h3>
    <p>
      We decided to do things a bit differently. We became legally married while living in Colorado in 
      Sept 2023 and shared a special solo day on top of a mountain exchanging our rings and our vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this marriage celebration, we want to bring everyone we love together in one place to share 
      memories, food, and drinks, and to dance around in the Vermont countryside. We plan to have a 
      short and casual ceremony and encourage anyone to share stories or words at that time!
    </p>

    <h3>Who can I bring?</h3>
    <p>
     If you're unsure if your partner or a plus one is invited, just reach out to Mike or Daley :) 
      <br>
      Kids are welcome!
    </p>
  
    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
    <p>
      We want you to dress in whatever way makes you feel your best. We hope you'll play some yard games 
      and get down on the dance floor with us, so wear something that makes you comfortable. 
      If it helps, Daley will be in a semi-formal dress, and Mike will likely not be wearing a tie ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a backyard venue with grass, so wear heels at your own risk! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring in VT is unpredictable, so please pack a jacket, parka, swimsuit, raincoat, and snow pants. 
      (JK, but prepare for any weather! We will be outside under a tent.)
    </p>
  
    <h3>Where should I stay?</h3>
    <p>
      We are hosting this party in the lovely teeny tiny town of Rochester, VT at Daley's parent's home. There are no major hotels in 
      Rochester, but there are a ton of beautiful AirBnBs, Inns, and Bed & Breakfasts. 
      (Check out our list of options <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ALbSv8pp6KdBSbLAF7YWLj_odjqthU6h4RIxBh4d9yg/edit?usp=sharing"><u>here</u></a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      We also encourage camping out if you're into that! You can stay right in the backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't mind driving to and from the wedding, there are a lot of options in the Burlington area 
      (about an hour from the venue, but in the same town as the airport).
    </p>
  
    <h3>Will there be an open bar?</h3>
    <p>
      This event is BYOB! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we won't be providing drinks, we don't expect any gifts from our guests! Instead, just bring yourself a beverage of 
      your choice for yourself or to share. 
    </p>
    <p>There is a small liquor store in Rochester and lots of local beers etc. available in town.</p>
  
    <h3>I heard there will be an open mic?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes! We have so many talented friends, so we asked them to take the stage during the first few 
      hours of the day. We'd love for anyone to sing or play a song if they feel like it!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can reach out and let us know you'd like to play, or you can just decide to get behind the mic if the wine is hitting just 
      right ;)
    </p>
  
    <h3>Will there be dinner served?</h3>
    <p>
      There will be a taco truck with unlimited tacos, along with other apps and snacks throughout the day. There will be vegetarian and vegan taco options!
    </p>
  
    <h3>Where is your Registry?</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of gifts, please just bring yourself and BYOB! Especially those of you who are traveling! We know things are 
      expensive, so you making the trip is more than enough :)
    </p>
  
    <h3>Is there anything else I should know?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes! There is only AT&T service in Rochester. We suggest you download your directions before heading out. 
      There is Wi-Fi at the venue if needed.
    </p>
